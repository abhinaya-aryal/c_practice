Character Input and Output:

The model of input and output supported by the standard library is very simple. Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters.

A text stream is a sequence of character divded into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.

The standard libray provides several functions for reading or writing one character at a time, of which getchar and putchar are the simplest. Each time it is called, getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. That is after,

c = getchar()

the variable c contains the next character of input. The characters normally come from the keyboard; input from files.

The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:

putchar(c)

prints the contents of the integer variable c as a character, usually on the screen.

Calls to putchar and printf may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made.

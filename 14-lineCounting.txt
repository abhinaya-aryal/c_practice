The standard library ensures that an input text stream appears as a sequence of lines, each terminated by a new line. Hence, countng lines is just counting newlines:

#include <stdio.h>

void main(){
	int c, n1;

	n1 = 0;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
		if (c == '\n')
			++n1;
	printf("%d\n", n1);
}


The if statement tests the parenthesized condition, and if the condition is true, executes the statement that follows

A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small integer. So, for example, 'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65.

The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constatnts, so '\n' stands for the value of the newline character, which is 10 in ASCII. We should note carefully that '\n' is a single character, and in expressions is just an integer, on the other hand, "\n" is a string constant that happens to contain only one character.
